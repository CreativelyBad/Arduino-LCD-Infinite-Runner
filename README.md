# Arduino-LCD-Infinite-Runner
This is an infinite runner game I made using the Arduino UNO R3 and a 16x2 LCD Display. Super easy to make and run if you are interested in trying it out.

# Parts Required
(1) x Arduino Uno R3
(1) x LCD1602 module
(1) x Potentiometer (10k)
(1) x 830 tie-points Breadboard

# NOTES
All my parts were from the Super Starter Kit UNO R3 Project from Elegoo
All the setup for the parts can be easily found online or in the elegoo starter kit manual
Try set it up your self for the challenge but if you can't figure it out or get stuck you can check the photo of my setup.

If you have any questions let me know.
