# Arduino-LCD-Infinite-Runner
This is an infinite runner game I made using the Arduino UNO R3 and a 16x2 LCD Display. Super easy to make and run if you are interested in trying it out.

# Parts Required
(1) x Arduino Uno R3<br />
(1) x LCD1602 module<br />
(1) x Potentiometer (10k)<br />
(1) x 830 tie-points Breadboard<br />

# NOTES
All my parts were from the Super Starter Kit UNO R3 Project from Elegoo<br />
All the setup for the parts can be easily found online or in the elegoo starter kit manual<br />
Try set it up your self for the challenge but if you can't figure it out or get stuck you can check the photo of my setup.<br />
